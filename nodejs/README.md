# Genetic Algorithm Hello World! (Nodejs Edition)

This is a simple project intended to showcase genetic algorithms with a well 
known example for all new developers; namely the classic "Hello, world!" 
example, written in nodejs.

## Overview

The application simply "evolves" the string "Hello, world!" from a population 
of random strings.  It is intended to be a gentle introduction into the world
of genetic algorithms, specifically with nodejs 4.6. 


## Usage

The project is completely self contained. To execute the application, run
the following command from a shell. 

### main program

> node gahelloworldmain.js

### unit testing

> node gahelloworldtest.js
